I am a junior developer who specializes in AI/ML engineering, full-stack development and game development.
I also do robotics and I do contribute to scripts in Arduino syntax,
as well as Raspberry syntax (I work with Raspberry Pi 4, 5 and various other models)
Please refer to my portfolio site for details about my work and offerings.
